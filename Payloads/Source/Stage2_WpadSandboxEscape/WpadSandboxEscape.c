Overview

This component of the chain will be compiled as a DLL and converted into a shellcode
prior to being encoded in JS and planted into one of the live Firefox or Internet
Explorer RCE. It is designed to initiate an RPC connection to the WPAD service within
svchost.exe (running as LOCAL SERVICE) via ALPC and simulate the functionality of
WINHTTP.DLL!WinHttpGetProxyForUrl (which is itself blocked by the OS). This results
in the WPAD service attempting to download a PAC file (a JS script) from a remote
URL of our choice and execute it in an attempt to update proxy configuration settings.

The PAC itself (on Windows 7 and 8.1) may force the legacy JS engine (jscript.dll)
to be loaded, and exploit it via memory corruption. In the latest version of Windows
10, WPAD has been thoroughly sandboxed: jscript.dll will no longer be loaded and
has been replaced with Chakra. Furthermore, the PAC file itself is now executed
within an extremely locked down child process called pacjsworker.exe which runs
as Low Integrity in conjunction with a slew of additional exploit mitigation systems
such as ACG and CIG. Despite this, access to the WPAD service (and the ability to
coerce it into downloading and running arbitrary JS in the form of PAC files) can
still be done even from most sandboxes (including Firefox and AppContainers) on
the latest Windows 10, thus making WPAD a persistent potential vector for both
sandbox escape and privilege escalation in the future.

When executed via Firefox CVE-2019-17026, this is the second shellcode to be run
as part of this chain and will be found on the heap by the JIT sprayed egg hunter
shellcode, set to +RWX and then executed via a CALL instruction.

When executed via Internet Explorer 11 Enhanced Protected Mode CVE-2020-0674 this
will be the first stage/initial shellcode to be executed, and will result in 
repeated continuous RPC calls to WPAD resulting in multiple payload execution.
This is due to IE11 running as Low Integrity being unable to create the global
event object needed to synchronize this shellcode with the Spool Potato shellcode.

It should also be noted that this code is designed to be run on Windows 8.1 or 10:
the WPAD RPC interface has changed between Windows 7 and 8.1 and the interface
information hardcoded into this client is for 8.1+. Before attempting to use this
client on Windows 7, the IDL file and all relevant interface information for WPAD
must be updated and re-compiled.

~

Design

Of significant note is that throughout my own testing, WPAD has only sporadically
been successful in downloading/running PAC files via this technique: it typically
takes several attempts (several RPC calls via this code) before the desired
logic is executed. For this reason, it was necessary to synchronize this shellcode
with the stage three shellcode (the Spool Potato shellcde) running within WPAD
so that this client could be notified when its RPC call had resulted in shellcode
execution and stop repeatedly making its RPC call.

In order to share the event object between the sandboxed shellcode running as
a regular user account and LOCAL SERVICE, it was placed in the global object
namespace (\BaseNamedObjects) as opposed to the default local namespace in
\Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects. The ACL for the event object is then modified
to allow access to LOCAL SERVICE, which by default will be unable to interact
with the object.

    SpoolPotato/WPAD client synchronization

    Oftentimes the WPAD client will be unsuccessful when attempting to trigger the PAC download from
    the WPAD service (the service will return error 12167). This issue is sporadic, and multiple attempts
    often yield a successful status from WPAD.

    To solve any potential issues which may arise in the WPAD client, the WPAD client must continue to
    attempt to trigger the PAC download until it receives confirmation via an event object from within
    the WPAD service itself: specifically from within a SpoolPotato shellcode executed as a result of
    the CVE-2020-0674 UAF.

    The WPAD client initially:
    1. Creates a sync event object in \BaseNamedObjects and then proceeds to repeatedly make RPC calls to
       WPAD in a loop.
    2. Between each iteration of the loop it spends several seconds waiting for the signal event it
       previously created to be signalled by SpoolPotato.
    3. Once the event has been triggered the WPAD client ends its loop and terminates.

    Meanwhile the SpoolPotato shellcode:
    1. Signals the event object to signal completion to the WPAD client.
    2. Makes its privilege escalation operations.
