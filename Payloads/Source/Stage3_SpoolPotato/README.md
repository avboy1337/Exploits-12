Overview

This source is designed to be compiled as a DLL and converted to a
shellcode prior to being planted into CVE-2020-0674 to be run via UAF
as a stage three shellcode to complete the exploit chain. It is utilizing
a combination of two techniques: the RPC printer bug (which allows an
arbitrary user/machine to request authentication via RPC named pipe to the
spoolss RPC endpoint of an arbitrary machine) and a potato-style impersonation
attack. 

Fundamentally, this shellcode is abusing the fact that the WPAD service is
running as LOCAL SERVICE, which is granted the (normally restricted)
SeImpersonate privilege by default. This privilege allows the WPAD process
to impersonate the security context of any RPC/named pipe client that connects
to it.

Additional information on the technique and its details can be found here:
