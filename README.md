```
This repository contains a personal collection of Windows CVE I have turned in
to exploit source, as well as a collection of payloads I've written to be used
in conjunction with these exploits. Some of these CVE have been joined together
in exploit chains for RCE, sandbox escapes and privilege escalation.

In order to use any of these exploits, clone this entire repository to your
local machine and either execute the .html files directly in your browser after
mounting the cloned folder to the E:\ drive, or run "python -m http.server" on
the main/parent folder and execute the .html files from localhost. 

Notably, all of the exploits in this repository are referencing the shellcodes
in the Payloads folder. You can modify these payload references to dynamically
select your own shellcode on a per-exploit (or per-chain) basis.
